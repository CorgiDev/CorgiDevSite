               <h2 class="a11ySubTitle">Why A11y?</h2>
               <p>You may have seen the name of this page and been slightly confused. Why <b>A11y</b> instead of <b>Accessibility</b>? A11y is a numeronym for the word Accessibility. A <b>numeronym</b> is where you form an abbreviation for a word by replacing some letters with numbers. The end word may, or may not, be pronounced similar to the full word.</p>
                <p><b>A11y</b> stands for the fact that Accessibility begins with the letter A, ends with the letter Y, and has 11 characters in between.</p>
