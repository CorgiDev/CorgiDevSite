                            <p><b>A11y</b> is a numeronym for the word Accessibility. A <b>numeronym</b> is where you form an abbreviation for a word by replacing some letters with numbers. The end word may, or may not, be pronounced similar to the full word.</p>
                            <p>A11y stands for the fact that Accessibility begins with the letter A, ends with the letter Y, and has 11 characters in between. It is used to identify content related to digital accessibility in particular.
