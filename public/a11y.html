            <p>It is important to note that any guidelines and/or tests listed should not be all you look for when assessing Accessibility. They should just give you a starting point in your overall Accessibility testing straetgy.</p>
            <p>Most are based primarily on WCAG Guidelines, which, as mentioned in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#:~:text=content%20more%20accessible.-,Following%20these%20guidelines,-will%20make%20content"  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">WCAG 2.1 abstract</a>, <q>Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities.</q></p>
            <p>We should be regularly building on what we test by using what we, or others, have learned impacts accessibility to improve testing coverage and improve the overall accessibility of our applications, information, and the world around us.</p>

                            <p>A11y stands for the fact that Accessibility begins with the letter A, ends with the letter Y, and has 11 characters in between.
