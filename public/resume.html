                        <li>Volunteered as a mentor for the Front-End Web Development Course offered by <a href="https://codelouisville.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Code Louisville</a> during the May 2020 session.</li>
                        <li>The May 2020 session was the first virtual session due to the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result, the other mentors and I were given the opportunity to help shape how we would mentor virtually rather than in-person.</li>
                        <li>Built out a <a href="https://github.com/CorgiDev/Code-Lou-FEWD/wiki" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Front-End Development Wiki</a> for all Front-End classes to make use of in my personal Repo. It was later copied over to the official <a href="https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Front-End-Wiki/wiki" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Code Louisville GitHub</a> so they could use it for future classes.</li>
                        <li>Lead the class in a discussion of Accessibility using my presentation, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ElizabethGray29/intro-to-accessible-web-design" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Introduction to Accessible Web Design</a>, which I uploaded to LinkedIn's SlideShare.</li>
