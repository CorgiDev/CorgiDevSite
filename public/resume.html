                        <li>The May 2020 session was the first virtual session due to the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result, the other mentors and I were given the opprotunity to help shape how we would mentor virtually rather than in-person.</li>

It was later copied over to the official <a href="https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Front-End-Wiki/wiki">Code Louisville GitHub</a> so they could use it for future classes.</li>
                        <li>Lead the class in a discussion of Accessibility using the my presentation, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ElizabethGray29/intro-to-accessible-web-design">Introduction to Accessible Web Design</a>, which I uploaded to LinkedIn's SlideShare.</li>
