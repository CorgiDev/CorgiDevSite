                        <div class="postContent">
                            <p>I recently started getting Azure credits and decided to have some fun seeing if I could host a Palworld server there. However, I ran into difficulties when I started to search for documentation to help me. Many skipped steps or were too vague. I ended up having to cobble together a couple of different pages and sift through Azure's documentation to find everything I needed. As a result, I decided to try to save other people some time by making my own documentation on how I created my server. I will include steps for creating a Palworld server based on Linux and Windows.</p>
                            <h4>Creating the VM</h4>
                            <p>Initially creating the VM in Azure is pretty straight forward and similar regardless of whether your end result will be Linux or Windows. One very important note with any VM in Azure, you will only be charged for the time your VM is running. So, to save on cost, shut down your VM when no one is using it. You can also set it to auto-shutdown at a certain time each day if you want to make sure you don't leave it running indvertently. I will also provide some Powershell scripts that you can use to check the status of your Azure VM in a separte post later.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Login the your Azure account with the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" rel="nonreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Azure portal</a>.</li>
                                <li>You should initially be taken to the Dashbord. From there you can select "Resource Group" to access the "Create a resource group" process.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>If you don't see "Resource Group" listed, select the "Create a Resource" option and search for "Resource Group" in the Marketplace.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/AzureDashboard.png" alt="Azure Dashboard with the Create a Resource and Resource Group options."> </br>
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/AzureMarketplace.png" alt="Azure Marketplace with Resource Group pulled up in the search.">
                                </li>
                                <li>You should now be on the "Create a Resource" page. Select the subscription if the one you want your VM in is not listed, and then type a name in the "Resource group" text input field.
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/CreateResourceGrp.png" alt="Azure Create a Resource page">
                                </li>
                                <li>Next click "Review + Create" and then "Create" on the next screen as long as long as everything looks like what you selected and typed.
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/CreateResourceGrp2.png" alt="Azure Create a Resource page create validation page">
                                </li>
                                <li>You will be taken back to where you initially selected to start creating the group. A pop up will display that you can select "Go to Resource" from, or you can type the name in the search bar to get to the resource group.
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/Go2Resource.png" alt="Pop up with option to go to resource.">
                                </li>
                                <li>Once you are at the resource, you will see a list of resources that is currently empty. We can start changing that by clicking on the "Create" option.

                                </li>
                                <li>This will take us to the Azure Marketplace. From here, go to the "Search the Marketplace" text input field and type "Virtual Machine".
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/AZVM.png" alt="Azure Marketplace with the listing for Virtual Machine">
                                </li>
                                <li>Click on the Virtual Machine option, and then click the "Create" button on the next page.

                                <li>This is where things begin to split just slightly based on whether you are making a Linux VM or a Windows VM. The following options are what you should select and fill out:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Resource Group:</strong> Name of Resource Group you created</li>
                                        <li><strong>Virtual machine name:</strong> Name you want to use</li>
                                        <li><strong>Image:</strong> Select either "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS - x64 Gen2" or "Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - x64 Gen2".</li>
                                        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Standard_B4as_v2 - 4 vcpus, 16 GiB memory (current cost / month)</li>
                                        <li><strong>Authentication Type:</strong> (Recommend selecting the Password type for Linux VMs. Windows VMs default to this.) Enter the username & password you wish to use.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/CreateVMForm.png" alt="Form to create a VM.">
                                </li>
                                <li>Click "Review + Create" and then "Create" on the next screen. The next screen will step through deploying the VM. This will involve it creating all the necessary parts. Most will have a data disk, network security group, virtual network, the VM itself, nd possibly other parts.</li>
                                <li>Click the "Go to Resource" option once the creation is complete. You can click away from the page while it is deploying, but you just might not be notified when it finishes. However, it will show up under the Resource Group once it is done. If you go to the Resource Group, click the item with the Virtual Machine name you entered and "Virtual machine" under the "Type" column.</li>
                                <li>Once in the VM dashboard, click the "Network settings" option in the side navigation bar.
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/VMDashboard.png" alt="VM Dashboard with Network Settings option highlighted.">
                                </li>
                                <li>Once on the Network Settings page, scroll down to the "Network security group" section, click the "Create port rule" button, and select the "Inbound port rule" option.
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/VMAddInbound.png" alt="VM Network Settings page with the Inbound port rule option highlighted.">
                                </li>
                                <li>An "Add inbound security rule" pane will display. There you need to set the following options:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Destination port ranges:</strong> 8211</li>
                                        <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> UDP</li>
                                        <li><strong>Priority:</strong> 100</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <img src="./img/blog_images/AzureVM/SecurityRule.png" alt="Add inbound security rule pane with settings entered.">
                                </li>
                                <li>You can also set a description on the pane to help you quickly identify th purpose of the rule later. For example, I usually add something like "Palworld Connections".</li>
                                <li>Once you have set the options, click "Add". This will ensure that the necessary Palworld connections can make it to the virtual machine.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong> You will still need to add a firewll rule on the VM itself once you remote into it the first time, but we will go into that later.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>The VM should now be set up and ready for you to begin setting up the Palworld server. This is where things completely split based on what VM type you are using. The VM automatically starts up after creation. So, make sure to shut down the VM if you are not continuing at this time to avoid extra charges.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>Setting Up Palworld on a Windows VM</h4>
                            <p>Much of this is written from being on a Windows machine. In particular, I am on a Windows 11 machine. However, this just impacts how you connect to the machine. Once you are connected and interacting with the VM itself, it is a completely separate machine.</p>
                            <h5>Connect to the VM</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Go to the Windows VM in the Resource Group and observe the "Public IP address" listed.

                                <li>Open the Start menu on your computer and type "RDP" to search for the "Remote Desktop Connection" program on Windows. Select the application when it shows in the results.

                                        <li>The credential window will default to your Windows account. You will need to click the "More choices" button and select "Use a different account" before entering in the credentials you set during VM creation.

                            <p>This firewall rule is basically the same rule as the one we set in Azure. You have to also set the rule in the VM itself.</p>

                                <li>Once connected to the VM, open the start menu and type "firewall". Select the "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security" result when it appears.

                                <li>Click Next again on the next screens until you get to the screen with the "Name" field. In the Name field, give the rule a name that helps you identify it later. For example, I named mine "Palworld Connections".

                            <h5>Palworld Server Pre-Requisites</h5>
                            <p>There are some things we have to install before we can begin installing the Palworld dedicated server needed to run a Palworld server. Once you get all of these installed, I recommend restarting the VM before continuing.</p>
                            <ul>

                                        <li>SteamCMD allows you to basically run Steam without the graphic interface, which allows it to be a lot more lightweight.</li>
                                        <li>For this one, I extract the installer into a "SteamCMD" folder in the VM's C drive.</li>
                                        <li>Once this finishes running, you can press CTRL + C to close the command prompt window.</li>

                                        <li>This link should install to the server. The main link you get when you search is a downloader installer and doesn't work within the VM for some reason.</li>
                                        <li>Before running this, create a "DirectX" folder in your Download folder. It extracts ALOT of files, but does not allow you to create a folder during the extraction process. So you need the folder you want the files to go into before you run it.</li>
                                        <li>Once you run it to extract the files, go into the DirectX folder you created and extracted the files into.</li>
                                        <li>Inside the folder, scroll to and run the "DXSETUP" executable to install DirectX.</li>

                                <li>Navigate to the SteamCMD directory. It will be wherever you extracted and ran SteamCMD from initially to install it, and then run the "SteamCMD.exe" file.

                                <li>Next, within that folder, navigate to "<code>/steamapps/common/PalServer</code>" and run PalServer.exe. A command prompt window will open that says "<code>Setting breakpad minidump AppID = [some numbers]</code>".</li>
                                <li>Close that command prompt window. Then back in the folder, open "DefaultPalWorldSettings.exe". Copy everything from, and including, the line "<code>[/Script/Pal.PalGameWorldSettings]</code>" to the bottom of the file, and then close the file.

                                <li>Next we need to edit a couple of settings. You can edit more if you would like, but these are just the ones needed to make our server function. Once you have made all of your changes, save and close the file.

                                        <li><strong>Server Name:</strong> Give your servr a name if you don't want it to just be "Default Palworld Server Name".</li>
                                        <li><strong>Server Description:</strong> Not required, but you can give a little description that you and users will be able to see under the settings when connected to the server. This could be useful if users have multiple servers they play on.</li>

                                <li>On the next screen, you will need to go to the bottom where there is an "Enter Password" checbox and an input field followed by a "Connect" button. Check the box if you added a server password. Then enter in the Public IP address of your VM with ":8211" appended to the end of it.

                        <h3 class="postDescrip"><time datetime="2024-03-21 13:10-04:00">March 29, 2024 - 04:00 am</time></h3>
                        <div class="postContent">
                            <p>One of my favorite things to do is add links in my email signature for people to DM me in Slack & Teams. I only use it for internal communications, but it tends to surprise people and is just an overall useful little trick.</p>
                            <p>I've also found these links useful in documentation. Maybe you have a list of contacts who someone needs to contact in a particular circumstance. You could include Teams links to ensure people message the right people and not someone with a similar name.</p>
                            <p>Follow along if you are interested in doing the same. Keep in mind that there may be some instances where the methods I show do not work for your organization. This could be due to some organization settings. I will provide a list of resources that might provide alternatives you can try. The ones I list are just the ones that worked for me most frequently.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Links to Direct Message someone in Teams</h4>
                            <p>Teams has proven to be the easiest one for me. With this you just use <code>https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=[your email address]</code>. Want to make it a group chat? Add additional email addresses separated by commas.(<code>https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=[your email address],[second email address]</code>).</p>
                            <p>One potential hiccup could occur if you have an old Microsoft 365 account where you had a personal and an enterprise version of your account. You will know if this is the case if Microsoft 365 asks you if you want to log in as your Home Account or your Work Account when you try to log in.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Links to Direct Message someone in Slack</h4>
                            <p>Slack is a little more complex to make a direct message link for. Keep in mind that someone must be a member of the Slack tenant to direct message someone using the link. This is why I typically only use these internally, and I always put a text note next to them stating that they are for internal use only.</p>
                            <p>Another important distinction of the link format I am about to cover is that it will open in the desktop app, if it is installed. There are other variants you can use, but many of them open in the web browser instead of the desktop app.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>First, we need to find you <code>Team ID</code>. To find this, you will need to login to your Slack environment via web browser rather than the desktop app.</li>
                                <li>Once logged in, look at the url in the browser's address bar.</li>
                                <li>The url will look something like the following: <code>https://app.slack.com/client/T05REF2GYN9/C06DFSGR5SB</code>. The set of charcters after <code>client/</code> is the Team ID.</li>
                                <li>Next we need your <code>Member ID</code>. For this, you can access Slack in the browser or in the desktop app.</li>
                                <li>Once you have the app loaded, go to your Slack profile in the app, or the Slack profile of the user who you wish to make a message link to. You can accomplish this by right-clicking their image in an existing chat or channel, and selecting "View Profile".</li>
                                <li>Once in the profile, you should see a set of 2 large buttons labeled either:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Your Profile: "Set Status" & "View As"</li>
                                        <li>Other User Profile: "Message" & "Huddle"</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Either way, there will be a vertical elipses icon that indicates the "More" menu after those buttons that you need to click to expand another menu.
                                </li>
                                <li>From that menu, select the "Copy Member ID" option.</li>
                                <li>Now format your direct message link as <code>https://app.slack.com/client/[Team ID]/[Member ID]</code>.</li>
                                <li>You now have a direct message Slack link for someone.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h4>Other Resources</h4>

                        <h2 class="postTitle" id="compTyping">Computer typing in reverse?</h2>
                        <h3 class="postDescrip"><time datetime="2023-05-09 18:09-04:00">May 09, 2023 - 06:09 pm</time> EST</h3>
                        <div class="postContent">
                            <p>I had a weird issue recently where my typing direction kept getting reversed. Basically, I would start typing and instead of the text going towards the right side of the screen, it would go towards the left. As a result, my sentences would be reversed from what I expected them to be. I could not figure out what key combination I was hitting to cause this until I did some research.</p>
                            <p>After doing some searching, I learned that this is a feature within Windows meant for languages where you may need to type in the opposite direction due to the way the text is printed and read. There can be some other causes, but generally the most likely causes are that you inadvertently changed the region on your keyboard, or you pressed the control (ctrl) key together with the left or right shift key. If you find your typing going in the wrong direction, first try pressing ctrl together with right shift for right to left typing, or with left shift for left to right typing.</p>
                            <p>If that does not work, try the one, or a combination, of the following options. Note that the following options, or the steps to alter them, may vary somewhat depending on your OS version.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Restart your computer</li>
                                <li>Check your system region settings. This is typically done by:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Start menu</li>

                            Alternate conformant versions is an important part of any Accessibility audit. When checking for this, an auditor is checking if inaccessible materials have an accessible alternate version identified. If an accessible alternative is available, an auditor can choose to skip any further accessibility checks on the non-conformant content and instead assess the accessibility of the conformant version.
                        </p>
                        <p class="postContent">A great example of content that has an alternate conformant version, is the <a href="https://adoption.microsoft.com/guides/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Product Adoption Guides <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square newWindowIcon" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span></a>. If you select to view an individual guide, you are initially taken to an interactive booklet version. The booklet is not Accessible. However, at the top of the page, there is a link to a PDF version of the same content that is accessible.</p>

                        <p>However, while having an alternate conforming version can be a good way to provide multiple ways for users to view the same content in a format they prefer; it can pose severe risk. When you have multiple versions; you have multiple sources of truth. This means you run the risk of one not being as up to date as the other, and having to remove multiple copies of the same information if you need it gone.</p>

                        <h3 class="postDescrip"><time datetime="2021-12-14 13:10-04:00">December 14, 2021 - 01:10 pm</time> EST</h3>
                        <p class="postContent">
                            Have you uploaded an image to RedBubble that was supposed to have a transparent background, and it instead was given a solid background? I have run into this issue on more than one occassion and always had to waste time finding a solution. So I decided to describe a solution here for my benefit, and others who may benefit.
                        </p>
                        <p class="postContent">
                            I tend to upload images to RedBubble to make custom content for my own use, or for my logo that I have listed in my RedBubble store. I use the free, open source image editing program known as <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square newWindowIcon" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span></a> to edit images. I also save images as PNG files since I now know what settings to set to consistently get transparent backgrounds.
                        </p>
                        <p class="postContent">In GIMP, you select "Export As" to save an image as a particular format. Once you do that, you can use the "Select File Type (By Extension)" to select the PNG file type. After that you click the Export button to progress to the next window.<br><img src="img/ExportAs.webp" alt="Export As dialog window in GIMP"></p>
                        <p class="postContent">You will next be presented with a set of Export options that are based on the file type. For PNG files that need to have a transparent background, you will need to focus on the settings in the bottom half of the window. You will want to make sure that the following settings are unchecked:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Save Exif data</li>
                            <li>Save XMP data</li>
                            <li>Save IPTC data</li>
                            <li>Save Thumbnail</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src="img/ExportOptions.webp" alt="Export As dialog window in GIMP with the previously listed options unchecked.">
                        <p class="postContent">Click the Export button once you have those options unchecked and upload your file to RedBubble. The transparent background should show up correctly now. I found out about this fix from a comment on a <a href="https://www.gimp-forum.net/Thread-Error-Uploading-to-Redbubble-Files-Exported-from-Gimp?pid=11542#pid11542" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">forum post <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square newWindowIcon" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span></a> on <a href="https://www.gimp-forum.net/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gimp-Forum.net <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square newWindowIcon" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span></a>.</p>
