## Author Information

Hi! I am Erissa Duvall. I got my professional start in Accessibility when I started working at the [American Printing House for the Blind](https://www.aph.org/) in Louisville, KY. Since then I have gotten my Trusted Tester Certification from the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/)'s [Offiice of Accessible Systems & Technology](https://www.dhs.gov/office-accessible-systems-technology). I have also gone on to work as a Quality Analyst for [GoodMaps](https://www.goodmaps.com/) and an Accessibility Engineer Contractor for [CVS Health](https://www.cvshealth.com/) through [Onward Search](https://www.onwardsearch.com/).

I have spoken at a variety of meetups and conferences on Accessibility, and mentor with [Code Louisville](https://codelouisville.org/) as a Wed Development and QA Mentor. My goal is to spread knowledge/awareness of Accessibility as much as I can.

Some of it is for selfish reasons. I myself have a variety of visible/hidden, physical and cognitive disabilities. The degree to which they are hidden/visible or how much impact they have on my day to day varies. However, I also want to see the world be more accessible for all. I want the world to be built for just how truly diverse people can be.
