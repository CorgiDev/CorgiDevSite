This repo is the source used to build my [CorgiDev site](https://www.corgidev.com).

## Author Information

Hi! I am Erissa Duvall. I got my professional start in Accessibility when I started working at the [American Printing House for the Blind](https://www.aph.org/) in Louisville, KY. Since then I have gotten my Trusted Tester Certification from the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/)'s [Offiice of Accessible Systems & Technology](https://www.dhs.gov/office-accessible-systems-technology). I have also gone on to work as a Quality Analyst for [GoodMaps](https://www.goodmaps.com/) and an Accessibility Engineer Contractor for [CVS Health](https://www.cvshealth.com/) through [Onward Search](https://www.onwardsearch.com/).

I have spoken at a variety of meetups and conferences on Accessibility, and mentor with [Code Louisville](https://codelouisville.org/) as a Wed Development and QA Mentor. My goal is to spread knowledge/awareness of Accessibility as much as I can.

Some of it is for selfish reasons. I myself have a variety of visible/hidden, physical and cognitive disabilities. The degree to which they are hidden/visible or how much impact they have on my day to day varies. However, I also want to see the world be more accessible for all. I want the world to be built for just how truly diverse people can be.

## Create an Issue

I love getting feedback. So please feel free to create an issue on this repo if you happen to be surfing my [Corgidev site](https://corgidev.com) and find an issue, or place you think could be improved upon. The following are recommendations that will help me resolve the issue or make improvements:

1. Format the name as either:
   1. [Improvement] Short title representing the issue found
   2. [Issue] Short title representing the recommended improvement
2. I have created templates in the following sections showing what details to try to include in the issues or improvements. You can include more information if you wish, or less. The details I list are just what I could think of that would help.
3. Include screenshots if possible and comfortable doing so.
   1. As a tip, on
      1. **Windows** you can use the Snipping Tool to just select a portion of your screen, instead of the whole screen.
      2. **MacOS** you can use CMD + shift + 4 to select just a portion of the screen for a screenshot, instead of the whole screen.
      3. With iOS and Android, you have options to crop screenshots you take in your device's photo viewer application.
